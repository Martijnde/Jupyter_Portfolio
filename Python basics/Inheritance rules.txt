Inheritance rules

When you use a variable anywhere in a Python script, the Python interpreter will look for the value of that variable using some simple rules:
•First start with the local scope, if any. If the variable is defined here, use the value.
•Look at any enclosing scopes, starting with the innermost. These are "outside" local scopes. If the variable is defined in any of them, use the value.
•Look in the global scope. If the variable is there, use the value.
•Finally, look in the built-in functions. 
•If no value is found, an error will be thrown.

A simple way to remember this is LEGBE, which stands for "Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-ins, Error".
