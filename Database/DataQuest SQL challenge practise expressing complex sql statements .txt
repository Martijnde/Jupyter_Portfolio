We have loaded the data in for years 2010-2012 for just recent college grads into a table named recent_grads. The full table has many more columns, 
21 to be specific, than the ones displayed above and they're explained in further detail on FiveThirtyEight's Github repo.

1: Here are the descriptions of the columns in the above snapshot:
•Rank - Rank by median earnings.
•Major_code - Major code.
•Major - Major description.
•Major_category - Category of major.
•Total - Total number of people with major.
•Sample_size - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.
•Men - Male graduates.
•Women - Female graduates.
•ShareWomen - Women as share of total.
•Employed - Number employed.


2: Select and Limit 
In this step, you'll practice using the SELECT and LIMIT statements.
Instructions
Write a query that retrieves:
The first 20 majors in the table, only these columns in the following order: 
•College_jobs
•Median
•Unemployment_rate

select College_jobs, Median, Unemployment_rate
from recent_grads
limit 20;



3: Where 
In this step, you'll practice using the WHERE SQL statement to express row filtering criteria.
Write a query that returns the first 5 Arts majors (only include the Major column).

select Major
from recent_grads
where Major_category = 'Arts'
limit 5;



4: Operators
In this step, you'll practice using the logical operators in SQL to express complex criteria.
Return all non-engineering majors with a median salary less than or equal to 50,000 or an unemployment rate higher than 6.5%.

Return only these columns in the following order:
•Major
•Total
•Median
•Unemployment_rate

select Major, Total, Median, Unemployment_rate from recent_grads
where (Major_category != 'Engineering') and (Unemployment_rate > 0.065 or Median <= 50000);



5: Ordering
Lastly, in this step you'll practice using the ORDER BY statement to customize the ordering of a query's results.
Return all non-engineering majors in reverse alphabetical order. We're only interested in the major names in the results and only the first 20 results.

select Major
from recent_grads
order by Major desc
limit 20;
